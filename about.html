                            What Does HTML5 Mean? Hypertext Markup Language revision 5 (HTML5) is markup language for the structure and 
                            presentation of World Wide Web contents. HTML5 supports the traditional HTML and XHTML-style
                             syntax and other new features in its markup, New APIs, XHTML and error handling.
                        Basics of HTML5. In this course you will learn formating page content, displaying images, landing pages or one page website. Understanding file paths, semantic markup, links and navigation, and setting up environment. </p>

                            The styling of a webpage can take enhance your page. When done
                            incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all. To ensure that your sites do not
                            put up barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, you will learn how
                            to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines. Upon completion of
                            the course, learners will be able to sketch a design for a given HTML page. Using that
                            design they will use CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and layouts.</p>

                            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
                            It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</p>

                           CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. 
                           On this course, you learn how this styling language will allow you to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. 
                           CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.</p>
